# 9.Standard-Input-Output-Error & #11.Hard-link-and-soft-link
 In Linux, standard input, output, and error are pre-defined communication channels or "streams" that allow processes to interact with the system. They are often referred to as file descriptors, although they are not actual files in the traditional sense.

#Standard Input (stdin):
This is the channel through which a program receives its input.

#Standard Output (stdout):
This is the channel where a program sends its normal output or results.
 
 #Standard Error (stderr):
This is the channel specifically for error messages and diagnostic output generated by a program.
 
 
 #11.Hard-link-and-soft-link

 #Hard Link:A hard link is a directory entry that directly points to the same inode as the original file. The inode contains metadata about the file, including its data blocks on the disk.

 #Soft Link:A soft link is a special type of file that contains the path to another file or directory. It acts as a pointer or a shortcut.
